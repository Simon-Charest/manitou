# Manitou Data Converter

## Introduction
This solution was developed taking into account the absence of a web API for the Manitou application as well as the fact that it is easier to use data from a database than a batch of XML files.

This solution:
1. Expects [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) files (i.e., data/input/*.xml), manually extracted from the [Manitou](https://manitousolution.com/application) application (i.e., Log In &rarr; General &rarr; Export data (beta));
2. Reads the said files;
3. Converts them to the [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data format;
4. Imports the data to [Azure SQL Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure_SQL_Database);
5. Which can then be used by solutions such as [Power BI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_BI).

To do:
- Manitou should include access to live data and its statistics, through to a web API, with secure authentication (i.e., OAuth 2.0);
- Manitou data should be segregated (i.e. one database per customer) and fully accessible by its owner, in order to comply with the [Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information](http://assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-64-42-1.html), which will come into force on 2023-09-22, in the province of Quebec;
- Manitou data should be segregated so that a superuser account is not required to export basic information;
- Manitou should include a reporting module (i.e., Power BI);
- Manitou data export module must be automatic, recurring and its data must be live (i.e., based on a replication of the production database, via a queuing mechanism).

## Install this solution
1. Download and extract the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/Simon-Charest/manitou) (e.g., Code &rarr; Download ZIP &rarr; go to This PC &rarr; Downloads &rarr; select file &rarr; context menu &rarr; Extract All... to `C:\temp\manitou`);
2. Run Windows PowerShell as an administrator;
3. Execute: `& "C:\temp\manitou\install.ps1"`.

## Export data from Manitou
1. Log in to [Manitou](https://manitousolution.com/application), with a superuser account;
2. Go to General &rarr; Functions &rarr; Export data (beta);
3. Click + Add, select a Start of extraction (i.e., 2022 January), enter a Number of periods to export (i.e., 6 (months, including the selected Start of extraction)) and select a Requestor (i.e., yourself);
4. Wait after 22 h that night for the query to run;
5. Click on the corresponding Consult button (paperclip icon) to download the archive;
6. Right-click the archive &rarr; Extract All... &rarr; Select a destination folder (i.e., `C:\temp\manitou\data\input`) &rarr; Extract;

## Convert and import data using this solution
1. Run Windows PowerShell;
2. Execute `python "mdc.py" --input "data/input/*.xml" --output "data/output" --convert --sql --verbose`.

For help, use: `python "mdc.py" --help`.
```powershell
usage: mdc.py [-h] [--input INPUT] [--output OUTPUT] [--encoding ENCODING] [--ensure_ascii] [--indent INDENT] [--mode MODE]
              [--convert] [--sql] [--verbose] [--test]

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT        Input pathname (default: data/input/*.xml)
  --output OUTPUT      Output directory (default: data/output)
  --encoding ENCODING  File encoding (default: utf-8)
  --ensure_ascii       Ensure ASCII encoding (default: False)
  --indent INDENT      Indentation (default: \t)
  --mode MODE          File mode (default: w)
  --convert            Convert data from XML to JSON (default: False)
  --sql                Import JSON data to Azure SQL database (default: False)
  --verbose            Verbose (default: False)
  --test               Skip import process (default: False)
```

The data will be imported, as JSON, into the "value" field, of the following tables, in a database named "manitoudb", in an Azure SQL Database instance.
- absences;
- activitiesTransfer;
- billedIncomes;
- CRMAccounts;
- employees;
- employeeSalaries;
- projectActivities;
- projectAssignments;
- projectContracts;
- projectDeliverables;
- projects;
- subcontractors;
- summaryDayAssignments;
- summaryDayEmployees;
- timeMoneyAdjustments.

Here is an example of a query allowing you to use the data, in [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms):
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT JSON_VALUE(e.value, '$.employeeId') AS employeeId
    , JSON_VALUE(e.value, '$.name') AS name
    , JSON_VALUE(e.value, '$.firstName') AS firstName
    , JSON_VALUE(e.value, '$.hireDate') AS hireDate
    , JSON_VALUE(e.value, '$.employementEndDate') AS employementEndDate
FROM employees AS e
WHERE JSON_VALUE(e.value, '$.employementEndDate') IS NULL
    AND JSON_VALUE(e.value, '$.email') LIKE '%@forensik.ca'
ORDER BY name ASC
    , firstName ASC
;
```
