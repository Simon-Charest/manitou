# Manitou Data Converter

This solution:
1. Expects [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) files (i.e., data/input/*.xml), manually extracted from the [Manitou](https://manitousolution.com/application) application (i.e., Log In &rarr; General &rarr; Export data (beta));
2. Reads the said files;
3. Converts them to the [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data format;
4. Inserts this data into a local [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) database file (i.e., data/output/db.sqlite), as [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) documents;
5. Which can then be used by solutions such as [Power BI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_BI).

Note: This solution was developed taking into account the absence of a web API for the Manitou application as well as the fact that it is easier to use data from a database than a batch of XML files.
